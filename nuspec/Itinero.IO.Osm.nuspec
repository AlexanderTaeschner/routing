        Itinero 1.3.2 Release Notes
        ---------------------------

        This is a minor release with a single bugfix:

        - Fixed issue in one-hop paths having incorrect edge id when within a single edge.

        ### 1.3.0 -> 1.3.1

        - Fixed issue in dualgraph builder not keeping topology.

        ### 1.2.0 -> 1.3.0

        New features:

        - Added the option to extract part of the network: https://github.com/itinero/routing/wiki/RouterDb#extracting-an-area
        - Added the option to write a routerdb as a shapefile: https://github.com/itinero/routing/wiki/Shapefiles#routerdb-to-shapefile
        - Added the option to keep original node id's and to keep meta-data on vertices: https://github.com/itinero/routing/wiki/Development-Plan:--Meta-data-on-vertices

        Bugfixes:

        - Fixed weight matrix calculation issues related to oneways: https://github.com/itinero/routing/issues/116
        - Fixed hilbert search sometimes missing closest vertex. Thanks @ironromeo

        ### 1.1.1 -> 1.2.0

        - Fixed maxspeed normalization issue.
        - Implemented support for nested relations by allowing multiple passes over relations if requested.
        - Implemented support for nested cycle route relations in the default bicycle profile.
        - Fixed directed weight matrix issue related to resolved points on oneway segments.

        ### 1.1.0 -> 1.1.1

        - Fixed issue with directed weight matrix being unable to handle new contraction hierarchies.
        - Fixed issue with directed edge-based routes not returning single-edge routes. This was a breaking change in behaviour.

        ### Itinero 1.1.0

        This update fixes the issues with the edge-based routing experience in v1.0. On top of that there are some more enhancements for network simplification and several bugfixes related to resolving and restriction handling.

        Extra functionality:

        - Calculate directed routes, arrive and depart on an edge in a fixed direction.
        - An extension method to optimize a network by removing obsolete vertices.
        - Added support for simplification of edge geometries.

        Behaviour changes:

        - Contraction performance improvements.
        - RouterDb's are bigger after contraction when using advanced restrictions.
        - Performances improvements when loading raw OSM data (thanks @airbreather).
        - Allow inserting a non-portable array implementation (thanks @airbreather).
        - Fixed bollard nodes restriction handling.
        - Added a more advanced network builder with support for single-vertex restrictions.
        - By default OSM restrictions are now for motor_vehicles.

        Bugfixes:

        - Fixed NUnit test runner (thanks @airbreather).
        - Fixed issue in hilbert search cause resolve to fail in rare cases.
